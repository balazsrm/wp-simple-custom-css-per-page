# Custom CSS Per Page WordPress Plugin

This WordPress plugin allows users to add custom CSS to individual pages or posts. It provides a metabox in the post editor for adding CSS and also extends the Quick Edit feature in the post list to support custom CSS. The plugin is compatible with the Gutenberg editor and outputs custom CSS on the front end only on pages where it's added. It is small, lightweight, and easy to use.

## Features

- **Custom CSS Metabox**: Adds a metabox in the WordPress post editor, allowing users to input custom CSS for that specific post or page.
- **Gutenberg Support**: The custom CSS metabox is also available in the Gutenberg editor.
- **Quick Edit Integration**: Allows users to add or edit custom CSS directly from the Quick Edit interface in the WordPress post list.
